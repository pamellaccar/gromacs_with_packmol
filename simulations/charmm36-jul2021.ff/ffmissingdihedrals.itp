; Dummy zero dihedral types for those which are missing in CHARMM
; Note: in some residue topologies in CHARMM, especially in the CGenFF part (e.g. C3, BUTY) some dihedrals have no
; corresponding interaction parameters based on the types of the participating atoms (e.g. C1-C2-C3-C4 in BUTY). 
; CHARMM simply ignores these dihedrals, giving you messages like 
; "CHECKDH> dihedral :    1    3    4    7 will NOT be generated". Grompp however gives you an error.
; As a workaround, this file contains [ dihedraltypes ] with zero force constant for these dihedral types.
;
; This file is presently empty, you can populate it by using `charmm2gmx findmissingpars`.
