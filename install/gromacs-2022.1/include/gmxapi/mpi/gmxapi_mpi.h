/*!
 * \brief Template header utility for connecting to MPI implementations.
 *
 * The client provides a communicator for work executed within the scope of the Context.
 * Client remains responsible for freeing the communicator and finalizing the MPI environment.
 *
 * To use this helper function, the client software build environment must be
 * configured for an MPI implementation compatible with the target GROMACS library.
 *
 * If the library and client software are built with compatible MPI implementations,
 * the template will capture the communicator in an opaque container that can be
 * passed to the ContextImpl creation function. Otherwise, the opaque container
 * will carry a suitable NULL object. The template definition is necessarily
 * provided by a generated template header, since the definition depends on the
 * GROMACS installation.
 *
 * \tparam CommT Deduced type of client-provided communicator.
 * \param communicator MPI (sub)communicator linking collaborating processes in the new Context.
 * \return Opaque resource handle usable when setting up execution context.
 *
 * \see createContext(std::unique_ptr<ResourceAssignment> resources)
 *
 * The communicator resource type is a template parameter because MPI_Comm is commonly a C
 * typedef that varies between implementations, so we do not want to couple our
 * API to it, but we cannot forward-declare it.
 *
 * See also https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues/3650
 *
 * \throws UsageError if the provided resource is not usable.
