/*! \brief Reads in data from tpr which can be used in construction of force calculators
 *
 *  This object reads data such as topology and coordinates from a tpr file, with the
 *  intent of using that data for construction of nblib force calculator objects. To
 *  allow for maximum flexibility in the calling code, it is the responsibility of the
 *  caller to, e.g., make copies if they want to preserve initial state information or
 *  use the data to construct multiple force calculator objects.
