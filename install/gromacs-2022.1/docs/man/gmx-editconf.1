.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgmx editconf\fP converts generic structure format to \&.gro, \fB\&.g96\fP
or \&.pdb\&.
.sp
The box can be modified with options \fB\-box\fP, \fB\-d\fP and
\fB\-angles\fP\&. Both \fB\-box\fP and \fB\-d\fP
will center the system in the box, unless \fB\-noc\fP is used.
The \fB\-center\fP option can be used to shift the geometric center
of the system from the default of (x/2, y/2, z/2) implied by \fB\-c\fP
to some other value.
.sp
Option \fB\-bt\fP determines the box type: \fBtriclinic\fP is a
triclinic box, \fBcubic\fP is a rectangular box with all sides equal
\fBdodecahedron\fP represents a rhombic dodecahedron and
\fBoctahedron\fP is a truncated octahedron.
The last two are special cases of a triclinic box.
The length of the three box vectors of the truncated octahedron is the
shortest distance between two opposite hexagons.
Relative to a cubic box with some periodic image distance, the volume of a
dodecahedron with this same periodic distance is 0.71 times that of the cube,
and that of a truncated octahedron is 0.77 times.
.sp
Option \fB\-box\fP requires only
one value for a cubic, rhombic dodecahedral, or truncated octahedral box.
.sp
With \fB\-d\fP and a \fBtriclinic\fP box the size of the system in the \fIx\fP\-,
\fIy\fP\-,
and \fIz\fP\-directions is used. With \fB\-d\fP and \fBcubic\fP,
\fBdodecahedron\fP or \fBoctahedron\fP boxes, the dimensions are set
to the diameter of the system (largest distance between atoms) plus twice
the specified distance.
.sp
Option \fB\-angles\fP is only meaningful with option \fB\-box\fP and
a triclinic box and cannot be used with option \fB\-d\fP\&.
.sp
When \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-ndef\fP is set, a group
can be selected for calculating the size and the geometric center,
otherwise the whole system is used.
.sp
\fB\-rotate\fP rotates the coordinates and velocities.
.sp
\fB\-princ\fP aligns the principal axes of the system along the
coordinate axes, with the longest axis aligned with the \fIx\fP\-axis.
This may allow you to decrease the box volume,
but beware that molecules can rotate significantly in a nanosecond.
.sp
Scaling is applied before any of the other operations are
performed. Boxes and coordinates can be scaled to give a certain density (option
\fB\-density\fP). Note that this may be inaccurate in case a \&.gro
file is given as input. A special feature of the scaling option is that when the
factor \-1 is given in one dimension, one obtains a mirror image,
mirrored in one of the planes. When one uses \-1 in three dimensions,
a point\-mirror image is obtained.
.sp
Groups are selected after all operations have been applied.
.sp
Periodicity can be removed in a crude manner.
It is important that the box vectors at the bottom of your input file
are correct when the periodicity is to be removed.
.sp
When writing \&.pdb files, B\-factors can be
added with the \fB\-bf\fP option. B\-factors are read
from a file with with following format: first line states number of
entries in the file, next lines state an index
followed by a B\-factor. The B\-factors will be attached per residue
unless the number of B\-factors is larger than the number of the residues or unless the
\fB\-atom\fP option is set. Obviously, any type of numeric data can
be added instead of B\-factors. \fB\-legend\fP will produce
a row of CA atoms with B\-factors ranging from the minimum to the
maximum value found, effectively making a legend for viewing.
.sp
With the option \fB\-mead\fP a special \&.pdb (.pqr)
file for the MEAD electrostatics
program (Poisson\-Boltzmann solver) can be made. A further prerequisite
is that the input file is a run input file.
The B\-factor field is then filled with the Van der Waals radius
of the atoms while the occupancy field will hold the charge.
.sp
The option \fB\-grasp\fP is similar, but it puts the charges in the B\-factor
and the radius in the occupancy.
.sp
Option \fB\-align\fP allows alignment
of the principal axis of a specified group against the given vector,
with an optional center of rotation specified by \fB\-aligncenter\fP\&.
.sp
Finally, with option \fB\-label\fP, \fBeditconf\fP can add a chain identifier
to a \&.pdb file, which can be useful for analysis with e.g. Rasmol.
.sp
To convert a truncated octrahedron file produced by a package which uses
a cubic box with the corners cut off (such as GROMOS), use:
