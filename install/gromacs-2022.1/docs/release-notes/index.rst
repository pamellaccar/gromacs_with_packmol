Release notes
=============

These release notes record the changes made in all major and patch
releases of |Gromacs|. Major releases contain changes to the
functionality supported, whereas patch releases contain only fixes for
issues identified in the corresponding major releases.

Two version series of |Gromacs| are under active maintenance and
within support lifetime at any time. In 2022, they are the 2022 series
and the 2021 series. In the latter, only highly conservative fixes
will be made, and only to address issues that affect scientific
correctness. Naturally, some of those releases will be made after the
year 2021 ends, but we keep the year of the original release in the
version name so that users understand how up to date their version
is. Such fixes will also be incorporated into the more recent release
series, as appropriate. Around the time the 2023 release is made, the
2021 series will no longer be maintained.

Where issue numbers are reported in these release notes, more details
can be found on the `issue tracker`_ at that issue number.
