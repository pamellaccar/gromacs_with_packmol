Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed bug with GPU LINCS occasionally shifting atoms in wrong direction
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Due to missing blocking synchronizations in the CUDA version of LINCS,
the shared memory was occasionally overwritten with the new data. This
may slightly affect the final coordinates of the shifted atoms.

:issue:`4199`

Fix calculation of restraint potential for large restraint deviations
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The calculation in the code did not follow the description of the potential in the manual
but the potential continued to grow quadratically instead of linearly as it should.

:issue:`4346`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
