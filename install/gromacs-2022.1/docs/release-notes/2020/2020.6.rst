Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cosine acceleration failed to abort if it could not be run
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Cosine acceleration is only compatible with the leap-frog
integrator (:mdp:`integrator = md`). |Gromacs| did, however,
accept input files requesting cosine acceleration for other
integration algorithms, and did report viscosity-related
quantities from these simulations. Since the cosine acceleration
was never applied in these cases, any results obtained from
simulations with enabled cosine acceleration and integrators
other than ``md`` should be regarded as invalid.

:issue:`3903`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix range checking bug in ``gmx covar``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A check was inverted causing range checking to be applied wrong.

:issue:`3902`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
