.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgmx analyze\fP reads an ASCII file and analyzes data sets.
A line in the input file may start with a time
(see option \fB\-time\fP) and any number of \fIy\fP\-values may follow.
Multiple sets can also be
read when they are separated by & (option \fB\-n\fP);
in this case only one \fIy\fP\-value is read from each line.
All lines starting with # and @ are skipped.
All analyses can also be done for the derivative of a set
(option \fB\-d\fP).
.sp
All options, except for \fB\-av\fP and \fB\-power\fP, assume that the
points are equidistant in time.
.sp
\fBgmx analyze\fP always shows the average and standard deviation of each
set, as well as the relative deviation of the third
and fourth cumulant from those of a Gaussian distribution with the same
standard deviation.
.sp
Option \fB\-ac\fP produces the autocorrelation function(s).
Be sure that the time interval between data points is
much shorter than the time scale of the autocorrelation.
.sp
Option \fB\-cc\fP plots the resemblance of set i with a cosine of
i/2 periods. The formula is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
2 (integral from 0 to T of y(t) cos(i pi t) dt)^2
/ integral from 0 to T of y^2(t) dt
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is useful for principal components obtained from covariance
analysis, since the principal components of random diffusion are
pure cosines.
.sp
Option \fB\-msd\fP produces the mean square displacement(s).
.sp
Option \fB\-dist\fP produces distribution plot(s).
.sp
Option \fB\-av\fP produces the average over the sets.
Error bars can be added with the option \fB\-errbar\fP\&.
The errorbars can represent the standard deviation, the error
(assuming the points are independent) or the interval containing
90% of the points, by discarding 5% of the points at the top and
the bottom.
.sp
Option \fB\-ee\fP produces error estimates using block averaging.
A set is divided in a number of blocks and averages are calculated for
each block. The error for the total average is calculated from
the variance between averages of the m blocks B_i as follows:
error^2 = sum (B_i \- <B>)^2 / (m*(m\-1)).
These errors are plotted as a function of the block size.
Also an analytical block average curve is plotted, assuming
that the autocorrelation is a sum of two exponentials.
The analytical curve for the block average is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
f(t) = sigma\(ga\(ga*\(ga\(gasqrt(2/T (  alpha
(tau_1 ((exp(\-t/tau_1) \- 1)
tau_1/t + 1)) +
(1\-alpha) (tau_2
((exp(\-t/tau_2) \- 1) tau_2/t +
1)))),
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
where T is the total time.
alpha, tau_1 and tau_2 are
obtained by fitting f^2(t) to error^2.
When the actual block average is very close to the analytical curve,
the error is sigma\(ga\(ga*\(ga\(gasqrt(2/T (a tau_1
+ (1\-a) tau_2)).
The complete derivation is given in
B. Hess, J. Chem. Phys. 116:209\-217, 2002.
.sp
Option \fB\-filter\fP prints the RMS high\-frequency fluctuation
of each set and over all sets with respect to a filtered average.
The filter is proportional to cos(pi t/len) where t goes from \-len/2
to len/2. len is supplied with the option \fB\-filter\fP\&.
This filter reduces oscillations with period len/2 and len by a factor
of 0.79 and 0.33 respectively.
.sp
Option \fB\-g\fP fits the data to the function given with option
\fB\-fitfn\fP\&.
.sp
Option \fB\-power\fP fits the data to b t^a, which is accomplished
by fitting to a t + b on log\-log scale. All points after the first
zero or with a negative value are ignored.
.sp
Option \fB\-luzar\fP performs a Luzar & Chandler kinetics analysis
on output from gmx hbond\&. The input file can be taken directly
from \fBgmx hbond \-ac\fP, and then the same result should be produced.
.sp
Option \fB\-fitfn\fP performs curve fitting to a number of different
curves that make sense in the context of molecular dynamics, mainly
exponential curves. More information is in the manual. To check the output
of the fitting procedure the option \fB\-fitted\fP will print both the
original data and the fitted function to a new data file. The fitting
parameters are stored as comment in the output file.
