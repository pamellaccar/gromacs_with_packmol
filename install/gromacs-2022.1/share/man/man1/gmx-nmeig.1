.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgmx nmeig\fP calculates the eigenvectors/values of a (Hessian) matrix,
which can be calculated with gmx mdrun\&.
The eigenvectors are written to a trajectory file (\fB\-v\fP).
The structure is written first with t=0. The eigenvectors
are written as frames with the eigenvector number and eigenvalue
written as step number and timestamp, respectively.
The eigenvectors can be analyzed with gmx anaeig\&.
An ensemble of structures can be generated from the eigenvectors with
gmx nmens\&. When mass weighting is used, the generated eigenvectors
will be scaled back to plain Cartesian coordinates before generating the
output. In this case, they will no longer be exactly orthogonal in the
standard Cartesian norm, but in the mass\-weighted norm they would be.
.sp
This program can be optionally used to compute quantum corrections to heat capacity
and enthalpy by providing an extra file argument \fB\-qcorr\fP\&. See the GROMACS
manual, Chapter 1, for details. The result includes subtracting a harmonic
degree of freedom at the given temperature.
The total correction is printed on the terminal screen.
The recommended way of getting the corrections out is:
.sp
\fBgmx nmeig \-s topol.tpr \-f nm.mtx \-first 7 \-last 10000 \-T 300 \-qc [\-constr]\fP
.sp
The \fB\-constr\fP option should be used when bond constraints were used during the
simulation \fBfor all the covalent bonds\fP\&. If this is not the case,
you need to analyze the \fBquant_corr.xvg\fP file yourself.
.sp
To make things more flexible, the program can also take virtual sites into account
when computing quantum corrections. When selecting \fB\-constr\fP and
\fB\-qc\fP, the \fB\-begin\fP and \fB\-end\fP options will be set automatically as
well.
.sp
Based on a harmonic analysis of the normal mode frequencies,
thermochemical properties S0 (Standard Entropy),
Cv (Heat capacity at constant volume), Zero\-point energy and the internal energy are
computed, much in the same manner as popular quantum chemistry
programs.
