.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgmx make_edi\fP generates an essential dynamics (ED) sampling input file to be used with
\fBmdrun\fP based on eigenvectors of a covariance matrix (gmx covar) or from a
normal modes analysis (gmx nmeig).
ED sampling can be used to manipulate the position along collective coordinates
(eigenvectors) of (biological) macromolecules during a simulation. Particularly,
it may be used to enhance the sampling efficiency of MD simulations by stimulating
the system to explore new regions along these collective coordinates. A number
of different algorithms are implemented to drive the system along the eigenvectors
(\fB\-linfix\fP, \fB\-linacc\fP, \fB\-radfix\fP, \fB\-radacc\fP, \fB\-radcon\fP),
to keep the position along a certain (set of) coordinate(s) fixed (\fB\-linfix\fP),
or to only monitor the projections of the positions onto
these coordinates (\fB\-mon\fP).

.sp
You will be prompted for one or more index groups that correspond to the
eigenvectors,
reference structure, target positions, etc.
.sp
\fB\-mon\fP: monitor projections of the coordinates onto selected eigenvectors.
.sp
\fB\-linfix\fP: perform fixed\-step linear expansion along selected eigenvectors.
.sp
\fB\-linacc\fP: perform acceptance linear expansion along selected eigenvectors.
(steps in the desired directions will be accepted, others will be rejected).
.sp
\fB\-radfix\fP: perform fixed\-step radius expansion along selected eigenvectors.
.sp
\fB\-radacc\fP: perform acceptance radius expansion along selected eigenvectors.
(steps in the desired direction will be accepted, others will be rejected).
\fBNote:\fP by default the starting MD structure will be taken as origin of the first
expansion cycle for radius expansion. If \fB\-ori\fP is specified, you will be able
to read in a structure file that defines an external origin.
.sp
\fB\-radcon\fP: perform acceptance radius contraction along selected eigenvectors
towards a target structure specified with \fB\-tar\fP\&.
.sp
NOTE: each eigenvector can be selected only once.
.sp
\fB\-outfrq\fP: frequency (in steps) of writing out projections etc. to \&.xvg
file
.sp
\fB\-slope\fP: minimal slope in acceptance radius expansion. A new expansion
cycle will be started if the spontaneous increase of the radius (in nm/step)
is less than the value specified.
.sp
\fB\-maxedsteps\fP: maximum number of steps per cycle in radius expansion
before a new cycle is started.
.sp
Note on the parallel implementation: since ED sampling is a \(aqglobal\(aq thing
(collective coordinates etc.), at least on the \(aqprotein\(aq side, ED sampling
is not very parallel\-friendly from an implementation point of view. Because
parallel ED requires some extra communication, expect the performance to be
lower as in a free MD simulation, especially on a large number of ranks and/or
when the ED group contains a lot of atoms.
.sp
Please also note that if your ED group contains more than a single protein,
then the \&.tpr file must contain the correct PBC representation of the ED group.
Take a look on the initial RMSD from the reference structure, which is printed
out at the start of the simulation; if this is much higher than expected, one
of the ED molecules might be shifted by a box vector.
.sp
All ED\-related output of \fBmdrun\fP (specify with \fB\-eo\fP) is written to a
\&.xvg file as a function of time in intervals of OUTFRQ steps.
.sp
\fBNote\fP that you can impose multiple ED constraints and flooding potentials in
a single simulation (on different molecules) if several \&.edi files were
concatenated first. The constraints are applied in the order they appear in
the \&.edi file. Depending on what was specified in the \&.edi
input file, the output file contains for each ED dataset
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the RMSD of the fitted molecule to the reference structure (for atoms involved in
fitting prior to calculating the ED constraints)
.IP \(bu 2
projections of the positions onto selected eigenvectors

FLOODING:
.sp
with \fB\-flood\fP, you can specify which eigenvectors are used to compute a flooding
potential,
which will lead to extra forces expelling the structure out of the region described
by the covariance matrix. If you switch \-restrain the potential is inverted and the
structure is kept in that region.
.sp
The origin is normally the average structure stored in the \fBeigvec.trr\fP file.
It can be changed with \fB\-ori\fP to an arbitrary position in configuration space.
With \fB\-tau\fP, \fB\-deltaF0\fP, and \fB\-Eflnull\fP you control the flooding
behaviour. Efl is the flooding strength, it is updated according to the rule of
adaptive flooding. Tau is the time constant of adaptive flooding, high
tau means slow adaption (i.e. growth).
DeltaF0 is the flooding strength you want to reach after tau ps of simulation.
To use constant Efl set \fB\-tau\fP to zero.
.sp
\fB\-alpha\fP is a fudge parameter to control the width of the flooding potential. A
value of 2 has been found
to give good results for most standard cases in flooding of proteins.
alpha basically accounts for incomplete sampling, if you sampled further the
width of the ensemble would
increase, this is mimicked by alpha > 1.
For restraining, alpha < 1 can give you smaller width in the restraining
potential.
.sp
RESTART and FLOODING:
If you want to restart a crashed flooding simulation please find the values deltaF and
Efl in
the output file and manually put them into the \&.edi file under DELTA_F0 and
EFL_NULL.
