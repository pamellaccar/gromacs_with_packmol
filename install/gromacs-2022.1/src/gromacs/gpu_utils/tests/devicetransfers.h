 * \brief Declares helper functionality for device transfers for tests
 * for GPU host allocator.
 *
 * Undefined symbols in Google Test, GROMACS use of -Wundef, and the
 * implementation of FindCUDA.cmake and/or nvcc mean that no
 * compilation unit should include a gtest header while being compiled
 * by nvcc. None of -isystem, -Wno-undef, nor the pragma GCC
 * diagnostic work.
 *
 * Thus, this header isolates CUDA-specific functionality to its own
 * translation unit. The OpenCL and no-GPU implementations do not
 * require this separation, but do so for consistency.
