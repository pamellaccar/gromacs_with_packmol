 *  \todo
 *  This function was copied from OpenCL implementation, not tuned for SYCL at all.
 *  Once SYCL2020 is out, might be worthwhile to look into USM and sycl::malloc_host / sycl::aligned_alloc_host.
 *  Overall, it is better to directly use sycl::buffer instead of pinned arrays. But this function
 *  is needed to compile some PME code with SYCL enabled, even if it is never used.
 *
 * \param[in,out]    h_ptr   Pointer where to store the address of the newly allocated buffer.
 * \param[in]        nbytes  Size in bytes of the buffer to be allocated.
