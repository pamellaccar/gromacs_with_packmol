/*! \brief Derivative-free downhill simplex optimisation.
 *
 * Find a local minimum of an N-dimensional mapping
 * \f$\mathbb{R}^N\to\mathbb{R}\f$ using the downhill simplex algorithm by
 * Nelder and Mead as described in
 *
 *       Sa≈°a Singer and John Nelder (2009), Scholarpedia, 4(7):2928.

 *
 * Stops when the oriented simplex length is less than a constant factor times the
 * initial lengths or when a maximum step size is reached.
 *
 * For best performance pre-condition problem magnitudes to 1.
 *
 * The following algorithm is implemented in this function
 *  1 Define the N+1 vertices of the initial simplex
 *      The inital simplex is constructed from the initial guess and N
 *      additional vertices by adding 0.05 to the initial guess (or 0.0025 if
 *      the initial guess is the null vector) from the initial vertex (in line
 *      with usual implementations).
 *
 *  1a Sort vertices according to function value with the lowest function value
 *    first in order to minimize the function.
 *
 *  2 Calculate the centroid of the simplex as arithmetic mean of all vertices
 *    except the worst, \f$ x_c = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}{N} x_i\f$.
 *
 *  3 Reflect the worst simplex vertex (the one with the highest function value)
 *    at the centroid to obtain a reflection point
 *    \f$ x_r = x_c + \alpha (x_c - x_{N+1}) \f$ which lies outside the vertex.
 *
 *  3a Replace worst point with reflection point if reflection point function
 *    value is better than second worst point, but not better than best and go
 *    to 1a.
 *
 *  4 If the reflection point is better than all other points so far, attempt
 *    an expansion by calculating the expansion point at
 *    \f$ x_e = x_c + \gamma (x_r - x_c) \f$. Swap out the worst point in the
 *    vertex with the expansion point if better than reflection point, otherwise
 *    use the reflection point and go to 1a.
 *
 *  5 Attempt contraction, because reflection was not successful;
 *    \f$ x_t = x_c + \rho (x_{N+1} - x_c) \f$. If the contraction point is
 *    better than the worst point, swap out worst point with contracted point
 *    and go to 1a.
 *
 *  6 Shrink the vertex. Replace all points except the best one with
 *    \f$ x_i = x_1 + \sigma (x_i - x_1) \f$ and go to 1a.
