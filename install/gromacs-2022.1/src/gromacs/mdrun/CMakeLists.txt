# TODO: Find a home for this header and a scheme for installation.
# This header straddles the installed libraries and is a transitive interface
# from libgromacs to libgmxapi to libgmxapi clients. Near term efforts are
# planned to consolidate these libraries and refine the public interface.
# In the mean time, this is kept out of the gmxapi to avoid circular dependencies
# between the libraries. It can be moved to a separate interface-only target,
# but that is beyond the scope of issue #3379, which introduces the header.
