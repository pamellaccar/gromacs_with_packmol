 * The ReferenceTemperatureManager allows to change the reference
 * temperatures of the temperature groups. Elements can register a callback
 * if they need to be informed about changes.
 *
 * The ReferenceTemperatureManager updates the inputrec. Elements
 * might, however, have a copy of the reference temperature they
 * need updated, or perform another action upon change of the
 * reference temperature (e.g. velocity scaling or recalculating
 * a temperature coupling integral).
