 *
 * When a test binary uses gmx_add_gtest_executable(exename
 * DYNAMIC_REGISTRATION ...) it must provide an implementation of this
 * method. The method is called before RUN_ALL_TESTS() and is expected
 * to call testing::RegisterTest to register tests dynamically. This
 * approach might be necessary to run the tests in a stable way over
 * whichever hardware is detected at run time.
 *
 * Normal test binaries do not need to implement this function.
 *
 * ::gmx::test::TestHardwareEnvironment::gmxSetUp() should be called before
 * this method, in case the test hardware environment is needed to help
 * decide which tests to register. */

/*! \brief Register tests dynamically based on the execution context
 *
 * This template reduces code duplication across the dynamically
 * registered tests, letting them register their tests more tersely.
 *
 * \tparam TestFixture  The type of the test fixture
 * \tparam TestCase     The type of the test case (derived from \c TestFixture)
 * \tparam Combinations The interal GoogleTest type describing the
 *                        return from \c testing::Combine() intended
 *                        to generate test parameters of type \c
 *                        TestFixture::ParamType (which is typically a
 *                        tuple).
 *
 * \param[in] testSuiteName           The name of the test suite that shares the \c TestFixture
 * \param[in] makeBriefNameOfTestCase Function that will make the brief name of the test case,
 *                                      used for naming the refdata file
 * \param[in] makeFullNameOfTestCase  Function that will make the full name of the test case
 * \param[in] combinations            A generator of test values produced with
 *                                      \c testing::Combine()
 *
 * Note that \c Combinations is actually well defined relative to \c
 * TestFixture::ParamType, but its concrete type is an internal
 * GoogleTest type, so we do not want to express it in code. In C++20,
 * it would be better to declare the function parameter like `const
 * auto& combinations` to achieve the same effect of hiding the
