Changes by GROMACS to muparser files
====================================
Used from https://github.com/beltoforion/muparser/releases/tag/v2.3.2.

ENABLE_SAMPLES is commented out so that we don't build them

ENABLE_OPENMP gets its value from GMX_OPENMP

Minor modifications exist to avoid compiler warnings, e.g. from
attempting to return a size_t in an int.

target_include_directories() is used so that GROMACS source files
find the muparser headers.

Test now links OpenMP target explicitly.
