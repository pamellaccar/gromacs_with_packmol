 * # Notes on scope
 *
 * Client owns Context and MultiProcessingResources, which exist entirely in client scope.
 *
 * Note that MpiContextManager and Session live in library scope.
 *
 * # MPI-enabled clients
 *
 * When an MPI toolchain is compatible with the GROMACS build
 * (see [#3672](https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues/3672)),
 * multi-process clients may determine how processes are allocated to GROMACS
 * simulations by providing Contexts with specific MPI Communicators to
 * createContext(const MultiProcessingResources& resources)
 *
 * MultiProcessingResources is an opaque type of library-internal resources.
 * Clients acquire such resources with the assignResource() template helper.
 * See gmxapi_mpi.h

/*!
 * \brief Execution context.
 *
 * The execution context represents computing resources and zero, one, or more
 * workflows to execute. All API objects exist in some context, which determines
 * how the API objects interact underneath the hood.
 *
 * A proxy can be configured with information needed to initialize a runtime
 * environment capable of executing a work load, independently of defining the
 * work.
 * The actual execution
 * environment is not necessarily instantiated / configured until the work is
 * performed.
 * Thus, construction of a Context object does not necessarily imply
 * initialization of compute resources, but any active compute resources are
 * appropriately deinitialized when the object is destroyed. However, to allow
 * opportunities for exception handling, resources should be deinitialized when
 * and as work is completed by the Runner.
 *
 * Ultimately, the class in this header file should just define an interface.
 * Implementations for different execution environments will be provided by the
 * library or extension code and documented separately,
 * and it should be straight-forward to
 * write extension code for other execution environments.
 *
 * \todo Further encapsulate resource state transitions with Session objects.

 * \brief Initialize a new API Context to manage resources and software environment.
 *
 * The client is responsible for keeping the Context instance alive for at least
 * as long as any API objects initialized from it. We allow this responsibility
 * to be placed on the client (rather than using a global Singleton) because the
 * library is theoretically reentrant, and multiple Context objects may exist.
 *
 * Client may explicitly assign run time computing resources for use within the Context.
 * Otherwise, the library will try to automatically detect and allocate computing resources.
 *
 * Currently, only MPI communication scope can be assigned explicitly.
 * Future development is needed before this interface can influence the subdivision
 * of available GPUs or thread-based processor allocation. See #3650 and #3688.

 * 3. MPI and client-provided comm: use compatible comm. error if COMM_NULL
