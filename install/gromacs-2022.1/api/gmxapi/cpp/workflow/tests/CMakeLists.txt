# Test with MPI.
#
# gmxapi is expected to work whether or not GROMACS was built with MPI (or tMPI)
# but we don't assume that MPI is available to the build tree or testing tools
# unless CMake was configured with MPI.
#
# For MPI-enabled testing of gmxapi clients using non-MPI-enabled GROMACS, we
# defer testing to the Python gmxapi client package tests.
